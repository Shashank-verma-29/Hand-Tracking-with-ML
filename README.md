# Hand-Tracking-with-ML


Hand Tracking Machine Learning Project ----->
Welcome to the Hand Tracking Machine Learning Project! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to track and analyze hand movements in real-time. Whether you're interested in gesture recognition, virtual reality applications, or human-computer interaction, this project offers a robust starting point.

Project Overview ---->
This project aims to build a hand tracking system using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The system can detect and track hand movements from camera inputs, enabling real-time interaction and analysis. The project uses a combination of deep learning models and computer vision techniques to achieve accurate and efficient hand tracking.
